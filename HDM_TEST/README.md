DB
---
At the begining of the test I have to set up a DB but I had some issues with the differents commands. <br/>
For example, starting mysql server and connect to it was an easy thing but in order to update the root password i keep facing the same issue and i didn't manage to do it. To not lose more times I skip this step so I can focus more on the 2 frameworks I had to use, as I never worked with them before. <br />
On the other hand, I had to create a Table, thing that I can handle but I realise that it was not very useful with Prisma.

BACKEND
---
On the Backend, I discovered NestJs and Typescript. I didn't feel lost as it looks like Javascript but with types and autocomplete. But to find a type defined in another file when discovering the subject makes me lose some time (the fact that _useCases_ didn't have the type for save).
Prisma was a good discovery : working with prisma types and DTO was a bit confusing but having a model that describe your Sql schema was interesting as it allows you to not create it by hand with all the commands.
I still feel more confortable with express.js as i did more things with it.

FRONTEND
---
On the Frontend, I worked for the first time with react, I passed more time to search how can i do this thing or is this possible than really work on my ideas. I would like to add a user system but I didn't have enough time to do so. However working in Tsx was a good experience : it's less confusing than having dedicated files and it's easier to manage dynamic data as you do not have to insert elements in DOM using _document.getElementById_ nor _appendChild_.
